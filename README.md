> A random emoji generator bot in Rust


[![Test](https://github.com/ShawonAshraf/summoner-emoji-bot/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ShawonAshraf/summoner-emoji-bot/actions/workflows/test.yml)

I have to approve a lot of pull requests, and I thought it would be fun to have a random emoji generator to use as an
approval message. Then I was suggested to make a discord bot based on it. There are two parts to this project:

1. **Emoji Generator CLI**: A CLI program that generates a random set of emojis as a string (currently hardcoded to 5
   emojis) from a predefined list and then copies it to the
   clipboard.
2. **Discord Bot**: A Discord bot that listens for specific commands and then responds with a random set of emojis
   or messages.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to create a discord bot application on the discord developer portal with the following permission and scope
> first!:
> `bot` and `send messages`. Also enable `GUILD_MESSAGES` permissions in the privileged access section so that the bot
> can read
> instructions.


Build the project locally (check [Local Build](#local-build)) and then run:

```bash
chmod +x target/release/the-bot

# for emoji generation cli
./the-bot emoji

# the file_dir should contain at least one file in fortune format
# check https://github.com/umpire274/rFortune?tab=readme-ov-file#-file-format

# for discord bot
export DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
./the-bot bot file_dir

# for guysay (a fortune powered cowsay)
./the-bot guysay file_dir
```

### Bot commands

- `!oracle`: Responds with a random set of emojis
- `!guysay`: Responds with a random fortune message in a cowsay style
- `!summon @mention`: Responds with a random set of emojis when a user is mentioned after the command
- `!joke`: Responds with a random joke from the [JokeAPI](https://jokeapi.dev/)
- `!gaysay`: Don't make this typo
- `!health`: Hits the health check endpoint of an api and responds with the status code. (you have to set the backends
  as env vars)
- `!no`: Tell your PM that you won't be doing it
- `!breakfast`: Breakfast cereal with AI? Anyone?
- `!sprint`: Tell your PM that this sprint ain't sprinting
- `!failed`
- `!biriyani`
- `!abubakr`
  
Example for `!health`:

If you want to check the health of `BACKEND_DEV_URL`, set the environment variable like this:

```bash
export BACKEND_DEV_URL=https://example.com/health
# the format is: <endpoint/service>_<environment>_url (all upper case)
```

Then run in Discord:

```bash
!health backend dev
# the format is: <endpoint/service> <environment> (all lower case)
```

### Local Build

```bash
cargo build --profile release
```

> [!NOTE]
> In case you don't have access to a machine running linux and would like to run the bot on some linux server, use the
> docker image for building the project for linux.

```bash
# make a directory at the project root named penguin to store the build
mkdir -p penguin
# Build the image
docker build -f penguin.Dockerfile -t bot-linux-builder .

# Run the container with volume mount to save binaries locally
# *nix
docker run --rm -v ./path/file -v $(pwd):/bot -v $(pwd)/penguin:/penguin bot-linux-builder

# windows (ps)
docker run --rm -v ${pwd}:/bot -v ${pwd}/penguin:/penguin bot-linux-builder
```

### Testing

```bash
cargo test
```

### Docker container

To run the bot as a docker container:

```bash
docker build -t the-bot:latest .

docker run -e DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here the-bot:latest
```
